Notes
Image Tag
Used to display images on the webpage.
src specifies the image path or URL.
alt provides alternate text when the image cannot load.
Anchor Tag
Used to create hyperlinks between web pages.
href specifies the destination URL.
target="_blank" opens the link in a new tab.
Block and Inline Elements
Block elements start on a new line and take the full width (e.g., <div>, <p>, <section>, <h1>).
Inline elements do not start on a new line and take only the required width (e.g., <a>, <span>, <img>, <b>, <i>).
Semantic Tags
Semantic tags give meaning to your HTML structure and improve SEO and accessibility.

Examples include:

<header> for header content
<nav> for navigation links
<main> for main page content
<section> for sections of a page
<article> for articles or independent content
<footer> for footer content
Tables
Tables are used to represent structured data.
<table> defines the table.
<tr> defines a row.
<th> defines a header cell.
<td> defines a data cell.
Forms
Forms are used to collect input from users.
<label> describes each input field.
<input> takes user data (text, email, password, etc.).
<textarea> allows multi-line input.
<button> or <input type="submit"> submits the form.
Key Takeaways
Block elements occupy the full width; inline elements occupy content width.
Semantic tags make code more meaningful and SEO-friendly.
Always include alt text for images for better accessibility.
Tables are ideal for displaying structured information.
Forms help collect user data effectively.
